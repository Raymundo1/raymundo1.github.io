These are few projects I have completed or still be working on.

        <a><b>Disaggregating Solar Generation Using Smart Meter Data and Proxy Measurements from Neighbouring Sites:</b></a> &nbsp;This paper investigates the problem of disaggregating solar generation from smart meter data when historical disaggregated data from the target home is unavailable, &nbsp;and deployment characteristics of the PV system are unknown. &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The paper has been submitted to one conference for reviewing.</span>

        <a href="/public/Solar_Disaggregation_Review.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Solar Disaggregation: State of the Art and Open Challenges:</b></a> &nbsp;Disaggregating solar power from net meter data has got traction in recent years as utility companies are seeking ways to identify behind-the-meter solar photovoltaics, &nbsp;improve their planning and operation practices, &nbsp;and apply variable pricing to distributed solar generation. &nbsp;In this notes paper we survey the literature on solar disaggregation and describe datasets that can be used for evaluating disaggregation methods. &nbsp;We identify limitations and threats to validity of this research, &nbsp;and discuss existing challenges and how they can possibly be addressed. &nbsp;These open challenges highlight the need for the development of advanced techniques and the use of other data sources to solve the solar disaggregation problem. &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The note paper has been accepted in the 5th International Workshop on Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring.</span>

        <a href="/public/500_Project_Report.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Disaggregation Based Occupancy Estimation:</b></a> &nbsp;Accurate room-level occupancy estimation is essential to different building applications for energy saving, &nbsp;smart building management. &nbsp;However, &nbsp;there is often a trade off between sensor budgets and estimation accuracy. &nbsp;In this paper, &nbsp;we try to find a balance point in those two metrics and propose a new occupancy estimation method by disaggregating accurate floor-level counts via existing common sensors available at room-level. &nbsp;The result shows our method can make the occupancy estimation with a average of 5.16 RMSE, &nbsp;which is lower than widely used method HMM of a average of 7.98 RMSE by using same sensor features on the same data set.

        <a href="/public/pcgmm.pdf" target="_blank"><b>PCGMM:</b></a> &nbsp;This project is a course project which relates to Probability Graph Model (PGM). &nbsp;In this project, &nbsp;we explore different Markov Models, &nbsp;such as multi-dimension markov chain and multi-layer markov chain, &nbsp;for Procedure Content Generation in the game <i>The Legend of Zelda</i>. &nbsp;We compare the performance of the models in terms of playability, &nbsp;diversity and style match.

        <a href="/public/697_Project_Report.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Unsupervised Anomaly Detection by Analyzing Power Consumption of Individual Households:</b></a> &nbsp;This project compares the performance of different unsupervised anomaly detection techniques on real world residential power consumption data. &nbsp;It also investigates how different feature consutrction methods affect the performance of anomaly detection methods. &nbsp;In addition, &nbsp;two different types of anomaly are defined and injected into the data respectively and used for evaluating different approaches.
