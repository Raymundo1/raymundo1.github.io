<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="/public/pcgmm.pdf" target="_blank"><b>PCGMM:</b></a> &nbsp;This project is a course project which relates to Probability Graph Model (PGM). &nbsp;In this project, &nbsp;we explore different Markov Models, &nbsp;such as multi-dimension markov chain and multi-layer markov chain, &nbsp;for Procedure Content Generation in the game <i>The Legend of Zelda</i>. &nbsp;We compare the performance of the models in terms of playability, &nbsp;diversity and style match.

    <li>
        <a href="/public/697_Project_Report.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Unsupervised Anomaly Detection by Analyzing Power Consumption of Individual Households:</b></a> &nbsp;This project compares the performance of different unsupervised anomaly detection techniques on real world residential power consumption data. &nbsp;It also investigates how different feature consutrction methods affect the performance of anomaly detection methods. &nbsp;In addition, &nbsp;two different types of anomaly are defined and injected into the data respectively and used for evaluating different approaches.
