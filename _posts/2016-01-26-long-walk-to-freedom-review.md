Recently, I finished reading Nelson Mandela’s Long Walk to Freedom and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The book takes you on a journey in Mandela’s shoes and you experience his life starting from his childhood to the days when apartheid was finally demolished in South Africa. It’s an autobiography and a large part of it was written by Mandela when he was in prison.


I would recommend the book to everyone who wants to learn about the brave and wise man that Nelson Mandela was. He sacrificed his family life and his own freedom so he could free his people from the shackles of apartheid.


I have learned so much from this book. I’ve learned about topics like politics and law. I’ve learned about ideologies like nationalism and communism. And I’ve learned important lessons about how diligence, bravery, discipline and honesty always eventually pay off. 

The book literally teleports you to 20th century South Africa and you actually feel the evil that apartheid was. At some points it gets a bit slow, while at others it’s a page turner. It’s a lengthy book but definitely a must read for everyone.  

The following are a few of my favorite quotes from the book.

> "It is easier to educate a man when he wants to learn."

> "No one is born hating another person. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than it's opposite."

> "For with women, I found the I could let my hair down and confess to weaknesses and fears I would never reveal to another man.'
