I've been meaning to start writing for quite some time now. This domain has been gathering dust ever since I purhcased it a few months back. But that's hopefully about to change. I've spent the past couple of days getting this website up and running and I can finally start writing. For me, writing is a very fulfilling activity. It gives me peace of mind and this blog shall serve as a platform for me to put out all my 
random thoughts. You'll find blog posts containing tirades, book reviews and even technical tutorials. I don't plan on ever monetizing this blog so one can expect sporadic posts because I'll only be writing when I really feel like it.
