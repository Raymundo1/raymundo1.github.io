<p>
I'm a Computing Science Graduate student at University of Alberta. My researches mainly focus on Sensor Data Analysis (e.x. Anomaly Detection, &nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonintrusive_load_monitoring" target="_blank">Non-intrusive Load Monitoring</a>) and Sustainable Computing.

Currently, &nbsp;I'm under supervision of <a href="http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~oardakan/" target="_blank">Dr. Omid Ardakanian</a>.
&nbsp;And I'm also working in <a href="http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~oardakan/research.html" target="_blank">Sustainable Computing Lab</a> which studies the foundations of Cyber-Physical Systems and the Internet of Things.
&nbsp;You can also visit the <a href="/projects">projects</a> page on this website to get an idea of what I have recently been working on.
